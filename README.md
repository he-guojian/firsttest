my first test
hard_sync_dut is the software driver of hard-synchronization framework for 3D-M-Box. A typical driver of hard-synchronization must be implemented carefully to deal with problems such as the absence of PPS signal, the transmission delay and data index association for multi-sensor data acquisition. 
The source code can be easily expand to other similar systems with slightly modification.
